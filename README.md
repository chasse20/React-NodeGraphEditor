# React-NodeGraphEditor
Basic node graph editor created in React. Uses CSS Modules, MobX, JSDoc, and d3-force.

[Live Demo](http://www.chassebrook.com/graphviz/)

## DESCRIPTION
With this tool you can import, edit and export a simple node graph.

This was originally designed to act as a foundation for a visual scripting tool similar to Twine. Underneath, its architecture is largely inspired by Unreal Engine's blueprint editor with the Node->Pin->Edge command pattern. This project has since been redirected and repurposed to visualize big data for the United States Army Operational Environment (actual source not included).
